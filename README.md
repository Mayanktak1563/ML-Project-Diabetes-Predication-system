# Diabetes Prediction System - MeriSKILL Internship
***
## Project Description
This project presents a predictive model for diagnosing diabetes based on the analysis of diagnostic measurements. The dataset utilized is sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, specifically focusing on females aged at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. The primary objective is to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes through the examination of various medical predictor variables.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable prediction model that aids in the early diagnosis of diabetes. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the system processes the provided diagnostic measurements to classify patients into diabetic or non-diabetic categories.![img 2](https://github.com/MayankTak03/ML-Project-Diabetes-Predication-system/assets/151378644/676d8ac8-cb94-4142-bbab-3e8d5e7b9983)

## About the Dataset Used
The dataset encompasses critical health metrics, providing a comprehensive view for predictive analysis. The key variables include:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Age
- Outcome: Target variable indicating diabetes presence (1) or absence (0)
